The main goal is to create an application in french that will work as a local catalog for the user, in preference using mongoDB structure.
In the application we will have two main pages, one for the catalog itself and one for the profile.
In the catalog :
    ps: honestly I don't really know a good way to put it, so that it will be more ergonomic but for the first version we will have
    - 2 buttons that will represent two choices, "Centre" and "Periscolaire"
    - If "Centre" is clicked then => "3 ans", "5 ans", "6 ans", "7/8 ans", "9 ans+" or we will have every activity and then we will have a button that says "tranche d'age" in wich we will filter out, I still have some confusions
    - If "Periscolaire" is clicked then => "primaire" and "maternelle"
    - In "primaire" => "CP", "CE1", "CE2", "CM1", "CM2"
    - In "maternelle" => "Petite section", "Moyenne section", "Grande section"
    - Then we will have three main categories : "Activités", "coloriage", "jeux"
    - In each activity (all the categories are the same data form expect if you see otherwise) : Title, Description, Image, Duration?, Location?, prerequis?
    ps : obviously coloriage is mainly just an image but yeah

In the profile page :
    - We can save all the progress in a file or a zip? I don't know, but we can save the progress of the user, like the activities he has done, the coloring pages he has colored, the games he has played, etc.
    - We can also have a button that says "Exporter" that will allow the user to export his progress in a file or a zip?
    - We can also have a button that says "Importer" that will allow the user to import his progress from a file or a zip?
    - We can also have a button that says "Supprimer" that will allow the user to delete his progress
    By default he will have an option to either import or to start a new file
    It would be VERY cool if we could adapt a gamifying system with xp, achievements, badges and stuff

feel free to upgrade the ergonomics, have a decent UI, and that's it
